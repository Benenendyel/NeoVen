# NeoVen - Neovim Configuration

Welcome to **NeoVen**, a personalized Neovim setup optimized for **Java development** and general coding.  

This configuration uses **Lazy.nvim** as the package manager and comes with essential plugins for productivity, language support, and aesthetics.

## Plugins I used:
- **Treesitter** – Advanced syntax highlighting and code parsing.
- **Telescope** – Fuzzy finder for files, buffers, and more.
- **Mason** – Easily manage external LSP servers and tools.
- **nvim-cmp** – Autocompletion for a smoother coding experience.
- **nvim-jdtls** – Java Development Tools integration for Neovim.
- **Autopair** – Automatically closes brackets, quotes, etc.
- **Rosepine** – A minimal and beautiful colorscheme for Neovim.
- **More-to-come** - I kinda wanna set it up for web development too

## TAKE NOTE:
